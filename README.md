# Description
An engine for rendering quizzes on screen.
Very effective.
# Documentation
QuizEngine v1.1.0 brought some new changes
that caused the docs to be changed. Now,
the most ideal way to use this renderer is
with QuizBuilder v1.1.2.
Also - the times on github releases for
QuizEngine are not exact. To see the time of
a release, see when the file quiz_v1.html was
last modified.
